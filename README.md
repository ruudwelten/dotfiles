# Rudi's Dotfiles

Welcome to my collection of dotfiles and scripts for customizing macOS and
Ubuntu to my liking. So far it contains only Mac specific code and as such it is
still a work in progress.

## Setup

**Do not** run the `setup` if you do not fully understand what it does! First
check out the script and when you fully understand it you can continue.

For now there's just a macOS setup, Ubuntu will follow in the future. To set up
these dotfiles run the following command in the terminal:

    $ bash -c "$(curl -LsS https://raw.github.com/ruudwelten/dotfiles/master/setup.sh)"

Or clone the repository first and install it from there:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ruudwelten/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    $ cd ~/.dotfiles
    $ ./setup.sh
